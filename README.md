## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about the temperature trends in Oahu. Specifically, we will investigate the summary statistics of the temperature data in the months of June and December to determine if this is a good location for a surf shop year round.

You can see in the above images the Summary Statistics related to temperatures in the months of June and December.
Some key differences:
- there is more data available for the month of june vs december (count = 1700 vs 1517 , respectively). This may lead to less accurate data in some cases, but considering how large these numbers are I feel it is still ok to take this data as accurate
- you can see that the average temperature in June is higher than that of December by almost 4 degrees, somewhat insignificant compared to most parts of the world
- December has a higher temperature varience than June, meaning temps will vary more day to day. Decembers min is much lower than Junes, however the max seen was comparable. 

## Summary
After performing this analysis, this seems like a great spot to open up a surf shop. The data shown in the months of June and December is encouraging, neither month reaching extreme highs or lows in terms of temperature, and both months having comparable average temps -- encouraging data if assumed other months follow this trend. Neither month has extreme temperature varience so we would more-or-less know what to expect weather wise daily.

If I were to perform more queries on the data, I would inspect every month individually to ensure that the temperatures remain (somewhat) constant and comfortable throughout the year. I would also like to inspect the precipitation levels for each month to see if certain times of the year bring with it more rain than others -- if this were to be the case this may effect the decision on whether or not Oahu is still a prime location.
